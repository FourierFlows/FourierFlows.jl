## Overview

This software provides tools for partial differential equations on periodic domains using 
Fourier-based pseudospectral methods. A central intent of the software's design is also to 
provide a framework for writing new, fast solvers for new physical problems. The code is 
written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

For more details refer to the [documentation](https://fourierflows.github.io/FourierFlowsDocumentation/stable/).


## Installation

To install, use Julia's built-in package manager to add the package and also to instantiate/build all the required dependencies

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("FourierFlows")
julia> Pkg.instantiate()
```

The most recent version of FourierFlows.jl requires Julia v1.6 (the current long-term-release) or later.

Last version that works with Julia v1.5 is FourierFlows.jl v0.7.2.


## Usage

See the documentation for tutorials on (i) how [construct grids](https://fourierflows.github.io/FourierFlowsDocumentation/stable/grids/) and use Fourier transform to compute derivatives and (ii) how to [set up a PDE](https://fourierflows.github.io/FourierFlowsDocumentation/stable/problem/), time-step it forward, and visualize the output, (iii) how to [add diagnostics](https://fourierflows.github.io/FourierFlowsDocumentation/stable/diagnostics/), and (iv) how to [write and read output](https://fourierflows.github.io/FourierFlowsDocumentation/stable/output/) from disk.


## Scalability

For now, FourierFlows.jl is restricted to run on either a single CPU or single GPU. Multi-threading
can enhance performance for the Fourier transforms. By default, FourierFlows.jl will use the 
maximum number of threads available on your machine. You can set the number of threads used by
FourierFlows.jl by setting the environment variable, e.g.,

```
$ export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4
```

For more information on multi-threading users are directed to the [Julia Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/).

If your machine has more than one GPU available, then functionality within CUDA.jl package 
enables the user to choose the GPU device that FourierFlows.jl should use. The user is referred
to the [CUDA.jl Documentation](https://juliagpu.github.io/CUDA.jl/stable/lib/driver/#Device-Management);
in particular, [`CUDA.devices`](https://juliagpu.github.io/CUDA.jl/stable/lib/driver/#CUDA.devices) 
and [`CUDA.CuDevice`](https://juliagpu.github.io/CUDA.jl/stable/lib/driver/#CUDA.CuDevice).


## Example(s)

A demonstration for how to code up and solve the linear shallow water equations is found
in the [Examples](literated/OneDShallowWaterGeostrophicAdjustment/) section of the documentation.

For more examples of `FourierFlows.jl` in action, see the child packages
[`GeophysicalFlows.jl`](https://github.com/FourierFlows/GeophysicalFlows.jl)
or [`PassiveTracerFlows.jl`](https://github.com/FourierFlows/PassiveTracerFlows.jl).

## Developers

FourierFlows.jl started during the on Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics Meeting 2017 by
[Greg Wagner](https://glwagner.github.io) and [Navid Constantinou](https://www.navidconstantinou.com).
Since then [various people have contributed](https://github.com/FourierFlows/FourierFlows.jl/graphs/contributors).
