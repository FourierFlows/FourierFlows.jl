# Aliasing

```@setup 1
using FourierFlows
using CairoMakie
set_theme!(Theme(linewidth = 3, fontsize = 20))
```

In pseudospectral methods, when computing nonlinear terms then aliasing errors come into play. 
These aliasing errors originate from the discrete nature of the grid and, specifically, the 
restriction that a grid discretized with ``n_x`` points can only resolve up to ``n_x`` 
wavenumbers in Fourier space. 

Consider a grid with a total of ``n_x`` points. Both harmonics ``e^{2\pi i k x / L_x}`` and 
``e^{2\pi i (k+n_x) x / L_x}``, with ``k`` an integer, are indistinguishable when evaluated
on the discrete grid-points of this grid. When we compute nonlinear terms in physical space
(products of various fields), we may end up with terms that project on harmonics with wavenumber
beyond the maximum wavenumber that can be resolved by our grid. In that case, those wavenumbers 
will be erroneously projected onto some lower wavenumber modes that fit our domain.

Take, for example, functions ``\cos(4x)`` and ``\cos(6x)`` and let's see how they are represented 
on a grid ``x \in [-π, π)`` with ``n_x = 10`` grid points.

```@setup 1
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!(type = "svg")
```

```@example 1
using FourierFlows, CairoMakie

nx, Lx = 10, 2π
grid = OneDGrid(; nx, Lx)

f1(x) = cos(4x)
f2(x) = cos(6x)

x = grid.x

fig = Figure()
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel = "x", limits = ((-Lx/2, Lx/2), (-1.6, 1.6)))

lines!(ax, range(-Lx/2, Lx/2, length=200), f1;
       color = (:steelblue, 0.3), label = "cos(4x)")
lines!(ax, range(-Lx/2, Lx/2, length=200), f2;
       color = (:salmon, 0.3), label = "cos(6x)")

scatter!(ax, x, f1.(x);
         markersize = 12, color = (:steelblue, 0.9), label = "cos(4x)")
scatter!(ax, x, f2.(x);
         markersize = 24, marker = :star5, color = (:salmon, 0.9), label = "cos(6x)")

axislegend(merge = true)

current_figure() # hide
```

The take home message is that on this particular grid we cannot distinguish harmonics with 
wavenumbers 4 and 6. An attempt to represent harmonics with wavenumber 6 on this grid leads to 
aliasing errors. For example, say that we are solving an equation and at some point we compute 
the product ``\cos(2x) \cos(4x)``. The result should be ``\frac1{2} \cos(2x) + \frac1{2} \cos(6x)``, 
but on this grid ``\cos(6x)`` is indistinguishable from ``\cos(4x)`` and, therefore, what we
compute will be indistinguishable from ``\frac1{2} \cos(2x) + \frac1{2} \cos(4x)``!

To avoid aliasing errors we either *(i)* discard some of the wavenumber components in Fourier 
space from our fields before we transform to physical space, or *(ii)* pad our fields with Fourier 
components with zero power that correspond to higher wavenumbers than those resolved by the grid 
before transforming to physical space. This way, the aliasing errors, which will involve the 
higher wavenumbers, will be either *(i)* zero-ed out or *(ii)* only come about for wavenumbers 
beyond what our grid can resolve anyway. In FourierFlows.jl, the former dealiasing scheme is 
implemented.

!!! info "De-aliasing scheme"
    FourierFlows.jl currently implements dealiasing by zeroing out the highest-`aliased_fraction` 
    wavenumber components on a `grid`.

The number of wavenumber components that we need to zero-out to be sure the no aliasing errors 
infiltrate our solution depends on the order of the nonlinearities. For example, for quadratic 
nonlinearities, one expects that we need to discard the highest-1/2 of the wavenumber components. 
This way, when computing the product of two fields we won't have anything that projects onto
harmonics with wavenumbers beyond those that our grid is able to resolve and, therefore, no 
aliasing errors.

The above-mentioned 1/2-rule for dealiasing for quadratic nonlinearities is, however, not the 
most efficient. Orszag (1972) pointed out that for quadratic nonlirearities, simply only discarding 
the highest-1/3 of wavenumber components is enough to save us from aliasing errors. To be fair, 
with Orszag's so-called 2/3-rule for dealiasing, still some aliasing errors occur, but those 
errors only occur to the higher-1/3 wavenumber components that will be zero-ed out next time 
we dealias our solution anyway.

When constructing a `grid` we can specify the `aliased_fraction` parameter. By default, this is 
set to ``1/3``, appropriate for quadratic nonlinearities. Then `dealias!(fh, grid)` will zero-out 
the highest-`aliased_fraction` wavenumber components of `fh`. 

```@docs
FourierFlows.dealias!
```

If we construct a grid with `aliased_fraction=0`, e.g.,

```@example 1
grid_nodealias = OneDGrid(; nx, Lx, aliased_fraction=0)
```

then `dealias!(fh, grid_nodealias)` will have _no effect_ whatsoever on `fh`.
