# [Time-stepping](@id timestepping)

FourierFlows.jl includes several time-stepping algorithms.

Most of the time-stepping algorithms are fully explicit schemes: [`ForwardEulerTimeStepper`](@ref),
[`AB3TimeStepper`](@ref), [`RK4TimeStepper`](@ref), and [`LSRK54TimeStepper`](@ref).
Also we have implemented an [`ETDRK4TimeStepper`](@ref) scheme with the improvements described
by [Kassam-Trefethen-2005](@cite).

The [`Problem`](@ref FourierFlows.Problem) constructor expects the chosen time stepper as
as string that includes the corresponding name of the time stepper _without_ the ending `TimeStepper`.
For example, `"RK4"` for the Runge-Kutta 4th-order time stepper.

## High-wavenumber filtering

Most of the time steppers also come with their `Filtered` equivalents: [`FilteredForwardEulerTimeStepper`](@ref), [`FilteredAB3TimeStepper`](@ref), [`FilteredRK4TimeStepper`](@ref), [`FilteredLSRK54TimeStepper`](@ref), and [`FilteredETDRK4TimeStepper`](@ref).

The filtered time steppers apply a high-wavenumber filter to the solution at the end of each step.
The motivation behind filtering is to preclude enstrophy from accumulating at high wavenumbers and
creating noise at grid-scale level.

The high-wavenumber filter used in the filtered time steppers is:

```math
\mathrm{filter}(\boldsymbol{k}) = 
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \quad |\boldsymbol{k}| ‚â§ k_{\textrm{cutoff}} \, ,\\
    \exp{ \left [- \alpha (|\boldsymbol{k}| - k_{\textrm{cutoff}})^p \right]} & \quad |\boldsymbol{k}| > k_{\textrm{cutoff}} \, .
  \end{cases}
```

For fluid equations with quadratic non-linearities it makes sense to choose a cut-off wavenumber
at 2/3 of the highest wavenumber that is resolved in our domain,
``k_{\textrm{cutoff}} = \tfrac{2}{3} k_{\textrm{max}}`` (see discussion in [Aliasing section](@ref aliasing)).

Given the order ``p``, we choose coefficient ``\alpha`` so that the filter value that corresponds
to the highest allowed wavenumber in our domain is a small number ``\delta``, usually taken to be
close to machine precision. That is:

```math
\alpha = \frac{- \log\delta}{(k_{\textrm{max}} - k_{\textrm{cutoff}})^p} \ .
```

The above-mentioned filter form originates from the book by [Canuto-etal-1987](@cite).
In fluid applications it was used by [LaCasce-1996](@cite) and later by [Arbic-Flierl-2004](@cite).

!!! warning "Not too steep, not too shallow"
    Care should be taken if one decides to fiddle with the filter parameters. Changing
    the order ``p`` affects how steeply the filter falls off. Lower order values imply
    that the filter might fall off too quickly and may lead to Gibbs artifacts; higher
    order value implies that the filter might fall off too slow and won't suffice to
    remove enstrophy accumulating at the grid scale.

The filter using the default parameters provided by the filtered time steppers (see
[`FourierFlows.makefilter`](@ref)) is depicted below. The same plot also compares how
the filter changes when we vary the order parameter ``p`` while keeping everything
else the same.
